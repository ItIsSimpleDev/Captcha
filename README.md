Captcha Application

This repository contains a simple implementation of a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) system in C#. CAPTCHAs are commonly used in web applications to distinguish between human users and automated bots.

Features:

Random Code Generation: The CAPTCHA code is dynamically generated using a combination of alphanumeric characters to ensure uniqueness and randomness.
Image Rendering: The CAPTCHA code is rendered as an image to prevent easy parsing by bots.
Validation: Users are required to input the correct CAPTCHA code to proceed, helping to prevent automated spam or malicious activities.

Usage:

Generate a CAPTCHA image by calling the GetCaptchaImage method with a unique identifier (GUID).
Display the generated CAPTCHA image to the user.
Validate the user input against the generated CAPTCHA code using the UseCaptcha method.
If the input matches the CAPTCHA code, proceed with the desired action. Otherwise, prompt the user to try again.
How to Use:

Clone or download the repository.
Incorporate the Captcha and CaptchaServer classes into your C# project.
Use the provided methods to generate and validate CAPTCHA images in your application.
Note: This implementation serves as a basic example and may require additional customization or enhancements based on specific project requirements.
